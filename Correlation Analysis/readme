In this directory, we have 2 datasets which are prepared in advance:

1. "us.csv"
"us.csv" contains the total COVID-19 case number in US, which can be downloaded by the following link:
https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data

2. "sector_info.csv"
"sector_info.csv" contains sector information of each stock trading in S&P 500, which can be found in wikipedia:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_S%26P_500_companies
The first table of this link is what we want, we used a online tool to download it, you can find the tool using the following link:
https://wikitable2csv.ggor.de/
You can just input the wiki link, then webpage will return several tables, download the first one and rename it to "sector_info.csv". 
(Note that renaming is necessary since our code will use this name to get sector information)

There are also 2 datasets generated by our code:

1. "new_case_number.csv"
"new_case_number.csv" contains the daily new covid-19 case number, which can be computed by "us.csv" 
using code "Get New Case Number.ipynb".

2 "stock_price.csv"
"stock_price.csv" contains the stock price from 01/02/2020 to 05/07/2020. We did not find the source data of stocks trading in S&P 500, 
we use "yfinance" library to download it in "Get_Stock_Close_Price.ipynb".

There are 3 code used in this part:

1. "Get New Case Number.ipynb"
Read "us.csv" and compute the new case number, store the result to "new_case_number.csv".

2. "Get_Stock_Close_Price.ipynb"
Use "yfinance" API download the price data of stocks in S&P 500, store the result to "stock_price.csv".

3. "Correlation_Analysis.ipynb"
Doing some analysis between new case number and stock price. Read "new_case_number.csv" and "stock_price.csv" 
to compute the correlation. Then use clustering (MOG) do some classification. Read "sector_info.csv" to do 
some analysis of stocks in terms of sectors.
