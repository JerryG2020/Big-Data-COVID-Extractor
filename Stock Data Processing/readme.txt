Because the dataset is too large to upload, you can download all needed dataset using the following link:
https://www.kaggle.com/jacksoncrow/stock-market-dataset

After you download it, open the directory "stock-market-dataset\stocks". All datasets are in this directory.
Note, you must keep your ipynb file and all datasets in "stock-market-dataset\stocks" in the same directory,
Otherwise the ipynb will not work.

Because the datasets are pretty large: more than 5500 stocks. It will take about 55 mins. After you get the 
result file "merged stock price.csv", you should move it to the directory that has ipynb file named 
"Merge_Stock_Case_Number.ipynb" to get the final result.
